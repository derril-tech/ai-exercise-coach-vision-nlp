## Product: AI Exercise Coach (Vision + NLP)

### Vision & Goals
Turn a user‚Äôs webcam into a **real-time AI fitness coach** that provides posture feedback, rep counting, tempo tracking, and spoken cues ‚Äî all on-device with optional cloud support. Deliver personalized programs, session summaries, and gamified adherence features while ensuring **privacy and safety**.

### Key Objectives
- Real-time coaching (pose detection, cues, rep counting).
- Personalized goal-based programs (strength, mobility, rehab-light).
- Exportable reports (PDF, CSV, JSON).
- Gamification with streaks, badges, and leaderboards.
- Privacy-first: on-device inference with optional cloud analytics.

### Target Users
- Home fitness enthusiasts with bodyweight/light equipment.
- Trainers/gyms offering remote feedback.

   - WebGL overlays for skeleton & angle visualization.  
   - Tailwind + shadcn/ui for design.  
   - Speech APIs for TTS/ASR.  
   - Dashboards, workouts, programs, leaderboards.  

2. **Backend (NestJS + Python Workers)**  
   - NestJS API Gateway with REST /v1 endpoints.  
   - Python microservices for pose detection, exercise classification, NLP, program generation, metrics, and exports.  
   - Event-driven architecture with NATS + Redis.  
   - Postgres + pgvector for structured & vector data.  
   - S3/R2 for exports & session clips.  

3. **DevOps & Deployment**  
   - Vercel (frontend), Render/Fly/GKE (backend).  
   - Managed Postgres, Redis, NATS.  
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD.  
   - Monitoring via OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry.  

### Success Criteria

  - ‚â•3 sessions/week median adherence after week 2.  
  - ROM/alignment +20% by week 4.  
  - Coaching helpfulness rating ‚â• 4.6/5.  

- **Engineering SLOs**:  
  - Pose inference ‚â• 30 FPS (on-device).  
  - Cloud fallback latency p95 < 120ms.  
  - Cue latency < 250ms p95.  
  - Rep detection precision/recall ‚â• 95%.  
  - TTS/ASR uptime ‚â• 99.5%.
